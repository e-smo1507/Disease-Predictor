Disease Prediction Toolkit: Building and Evaluating ML Models


📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) can be applied in healthcare to predict diseases using real-world datasets.

The goal is to build a Disease Prediction Toolkit that:

Preprocesses healthcare datasets (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).

Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Evaluates models with industry-standard metrics.

Visualizes results with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.

Provides a portfolio-ready project for AI/ML and healthcare roles.



🎯 Objectives

Learn fundamentals of ML model development.

Apply data preprocessing & feature engineering on healthcare data.

Train and optimize multiple ML algorithms.

Compare models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Showcase results with visualizations and documentation.



📂 Dataset

We used publicly available healthcare datasets from Kaggle, such as:
